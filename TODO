- BUG bgm not playing
- BUG loading screen style in landscape mode
- BUG screen(page) switching animation not working

- use iron-pages to switch between loadingScreen, openingScreen, settingScreen, storyScreen, videoScreen
- remove dom for loadingScreen after page transition

- skip vulcanize when developing
- options node style
- let the `loader` element contain the `loader` image itself
- serve roboto font from cdn in some case ( like online version )

- pass env from gulp to app

- backgrounds transition: fading in and fading out in the same time; more transitions
- bgm: replace with a toast
