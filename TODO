- BUG bundle (vulcanize) + online (cdnize) = [::_flattenBehaviorsList]: behavior is null

- serve roboto font from cdn in online version

- BUG bgm not playing
- BUG loading screen style in landscape mode

- BUG screen(page) switching animation not working:
  iron-pages: cannot set pages transition animation via the animationConfig property in pages itself, setting via the property on `iron-pages` is working.

- remove dom for loadingScreen after page transition

- let the `loader` element contain the `loader` image itself

- pass env from gulp to app

- backgrounds transition: fading in and fading out in the same time; more transitions

- option for Google Analytics
- option for integrating bugsnag

- resolve deprecated iron-flex-layout.html:
  This file is deprecated. Please use `iron-flex-layout/iron-flex-layout-classes.html`, and one of the specific dom-modules instead

- proper loading process
  - the loader should be shown at the very first
  - the laoder should wait for the font being loaded

- dynamically declare `config`, `resources` for all elements/components
